This code should accomplish goal 3 in the changes.txt file
Goal 3 is copied below:
3) QUIC must allow for a new frame type to be sent in the initial packet: a path frame specifying how to reply.
a) The client is to send this frame in its initial message
b) The server is to print this frame

Frames are being sent but has wrong format and so is being rejected.
Need to place length of data in 3 bytes before ReplyPath

ReplyPath Object was previously placed inside the crypto frame a second object. This needs to be fixed and moved to its correct location as its own frame inside an initial packet.
